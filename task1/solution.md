# Text Transformer 📝

A simple Python script that uses regular expressions (`regex`) to find and transform specific patterns within a given text string.

-----

## ✨ Features

This script performs three main transformations:

  * **🕵️ Redacts Numbers**: Finds and replaces any number matching the pattern `XXXXX-XXXXX` with `[REDACTED]`. This is useful for masking sensitive information like phone numbers.
  * **📅 Reformats Dates**: Converts dates from `YYYY-MM-DD` format to a more readable format, like `23rd August 2025`.
  * **🐍 Emojifies Text**: Replaces every instance of the word "Python" with a snake emoji (🐍).

-----

## ⚙️ Requirements

  * Python 3.x
  * The `emoji` library

-----

## 🚀 Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Install the required package:**

    ```bash
    pip install emoji
    ```

-----

## 🛠️ Usage

You can run the script directly from the command line to see the example output, or you can import the `transform_text` function into your own Python projects.

### As a Standalone Script

To run the built-in example, simply execute the Python file:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

### In Your Own Code

Import the `transform_text` function and pass any string to it.

```python
from your_script_name import transform_text

# Example usage
input_string = "Contact support at 55501-99988 by 2025-12-25. We need a Python expert."

transformed_string = transform_text(input_string)

print(f"Original: {input_string}")
print(f"Transformed: {transformed_string}")
```

## 📋 Example

Here is a quick demonstration of the script's functionality.

**Input Text:**

```
Call me at 98123-45678 on 2025-08-23. I love Python more than Java.
```

**Transformed Output:**

```
Call me at [REDACTED] on 23rd August 2025. I love 🐍 more than Java.
```
